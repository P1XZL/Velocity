### **Enhanced Controls, UI & Stability**
- Search for and adjust keybinds easily
- Improved F3 menu for clearer debug information
- Mouse tweaks for smoother inventory interactions
- Monitor your **ping** and others' in real time
- See **OptiFine, LabyMod, and MinecraftCapes** in-game

### **Extras**
- Shader support for vibrant and dynamic lighting
- Reduced visual obstructions (lowered fire, shield, etc.)
- View maps while boating
- Smooth camera zoom for better navigation

<summary>FAQ</summary>

| Question & Answer |
|---|
| **Q1: How much RAM should I allocate to Velocity?**<br>A minimum of half a gigabyte (512MB) is required, but allocating at least 1GB to 2GB is recommended for the best experience. |
| **Q2: How do I enable/add shaders? Are any included?**<br>No shaders are included by default. To add and enable shaders:<br>1. Press 'O' (or navigate via Settings > Video Settings > Shader Packs...).<br>2. Click the 'Plus' (+) button or 'Open Shader Pack Folder'.<br>3. Download your desired shader pack (e.g., from Modrinth or CurseForge) and place the .zip file in the folder that opens.<br>4. Back in Minecraft, select the shader from the list.<br>5. Click 'Apply' and close the menu. |
| **Q3: Is OptiFine compatible? Do I need it?**<br>No, OptiFine is **not compatible** with this Fabric-based modpack and is not needed. Velocity includes mods like Sodium, Iris, Zoomify, Capes, etc., which provide replacements for most of OptiFine's features (performance boosts, shader support, zoom, cape rendering) and often offer better performance and compatibility within the Fabric ecosystem. |
| **Q4: Can I add other mods to Velocity?**<br>Yes, most Fabric mods compatible with the Minecraft version should work. Velocity aims for high compatibility. However, if you don't want the custom main menu/GUI provided, you can disable or remove the 'FancyMenu' mod from the modpack files. |
| **Q5: My performance isn't as good as expected, what can I try?**<br>• **RAM:** Ensure you've allocated enough RAM (1GB-2GB recommended).<br>• **Storage:** Using an SSD instead of an HDD significantly improves loading times and reduces stutter.<br>• **CPU:** A faster CPU helps with game logic and handling mods.<br>• **GPU:** If you are using demanding shaders, a more powerful GPU will be necessary for good framerates. Consider trying less intensive shaders or disabling them if performance is low.<br>• Check background applications closing unnecessary ones. |
| **Q6: How do I use the zoom feature?**<br>Hold down the 'C' key (by default) to zoom in. While holding 'C', you can use your mouse scroll wheel to adjust the zoom level further. |
| **Q7: Where can I report bugs or ask for help?**<br>You can report bugs or issues on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/P1XZL/Velocity/issues) or contact me directly on Discord: `P1XZL.` |
| **Q8: What makes Velocity different from other performance modpacks?**<br>Velocity focuses on maximizing game performance and responsiveness without sacrificing visuals, compatibility with other mods, or useful quality-of-life enhancements. It aims to be a well-rounded pack that improves the vanilla experience while remaining stable and user-friendly. |
